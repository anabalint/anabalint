# About me
I graduated from the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration in Ia»ôi with a bachelor's thesis in Business
Informatics. My previous experience includes working as a Low Code Trainee, where I gained experience in Business
Analysis, UML, soft skills, and software development on low-code platforms such as CodeX and Mendix. I am eager to
further develop professionally in an entry-level job or internship focused on web development or low code
development.
